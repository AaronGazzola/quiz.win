# Project Roadmap Template & Instructions

This document provides a comprehensive template for creating detailed implementation roadmaps for software projects. Use this template to break down complex projects into manageable phases with clear deliverables and tracking.

## Purpose & Intended Use

A project roadmap serves as:

- **Implementation Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for building complete features
- **Progress Tracker**: Live document showing current status and remaining work
- **Reference Document**: Historical record of development decisions and implementations
- **Scope Manager**: Clear boundaries for what gets built in each phase
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing and verification at each stage

## Roadmap Structure & Format

### 1. Document Header

```markdown
# [Project Name] Complete Implementation Roadmap

Brief description of what the roadmap accomplishes and its scope.

## üéØ Current Status (Updated: [Date])

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED PHASES

- **Phase 1: [Name]** - Brief description of completed work
- **Phase 2: [Name]** - Brief description of completed work

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS

- **[Current Phase]**: Brief description of current work

### ‚è≥ REMAINING WORK

- **[Next Phase]**: Brief description of upcoming work
- **[Future Phase]**: Brief description of future work

### üöÄ READY TO USE

Detailed list of what users can currently do with the application:

- Feature 1 with specific capabilities
- Feature 2 with specific capabilities
- **NEW**: Recently added features highlighted

### üìç NEXT STEPS

1. Immediate next action items
2. Priority tasks for current phase
3. Preparation work for upcoming phases
```

### 2. Prerequisites Section

```markdown
## Prerequisites

- ‚úÖ Environment setup requirements
- ‚úÖ Dependencies and integrations
- ‚úÖ Database schema and configurations
- ‚úÖ API keys and external services
```

### 3. Phase Structure

Each phase should follow this pattern:

```markdown
## ‚úÖ Phase X: [Phase Name] (STATUS)

Brief description of phase goals and deliverables.

### ‚úÖ X.1 [Component Name] (`file/path.ts`) - STATUS

Description of what needs to be implemented:

- Specific requirement 1 with technical details
- Specific requirement 2 with technical details
- Error handling and edge cases
- Integration points with other components

**Key Methods/Features Required:**

- `methodName(params)` - Description of functionality
- `anotherMethod(params)` - Description of functionality

### ‚úÖ X.2 [Another Component] - STATUS

[Follow same pattern as above]

### ‚úÖ X.3 Enhanced Features Added:

- ‚úÖ **Feature Name** - Description of enhancement
- ‚úÖ **Integration Points** - How components work together
- ‚úÖ **Performance Improvements** - Optimizations implemented
```

## Content Organization Guidelines

### Phase Planning

1. **Logical Dependencies**: Each phase builds on previous phases
2. **Testable Milestones**: Each phase produces working functionality
3. **Manageable Scope**: Phases should take 1-3 days of focused work
4. **Clear Boundaries**: No overlap between phase responsibilities

### Task Breakdown

1. **Component Level**: Break down by files or logical components
2. **Method Level**: Specify exact functions and APIs needed
3. **Integration Level**: Define how components interact
4. **Error Handling**: Include error scenarios and edge cases

### Technical Details

Include in each task:

- File paths where code will be implemented
- Key methods and their signatures
- Integration points with existing code
- Error handling requirements
- Testing verification steps

## Status Management System

### Status Indicators

- **‚úÖ COMPLETED**: Feature is fully implemented and tested
- **üîÑ IN PROGRESS**: Currently being worked on
- **‚è≥ REMAINING**: Planned for future implementation
- **üöÄ READY TO USE**: Available for users in current state

### Progress Tracking

- Update status section with each major milestone
- Move completed items from "IN PROGRESS" to "COMPLETED"
- Add new features discovered during implementation
- Maintain "READY TO USE" section showing current capabilities

### Git Integration

- Commit messages should reference phase completion: `feat(phaseX): complete [Phase Name] implementation`
- Tag major milestones for easy reference
- Include roadmap updates in feature commits

## Implementation Approach

### Sequential Development

```
Phase 1 ‚Üí Complete & Test ‚Üí Phase 2 ‚Üí Complete & Test ‚Üí Phase 3...
```

### Quality Gates

After each phase:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
3. **Manual Testing**: Verify user-facing functionality
4. **Error Testing**: Test edge cases and error scenarios
5. **Performance Testing**: Ensure acceptable performance

### Documentation Updates

- Update roadmap status after each phase
- Document any implementation decisions or changes
- Add new requirements discovered during development
- Update "READY TO USE" section with new capabilities

## Generic Examples

### Web Application Roadmap

## Best Practices

### Roadmap Creation

1. **Start with MVP**: Define minimum viable product in Phase 1
2. **Build Incrementally**: Each phase adds value to previous phases
3. **Plan for Testing**: Include testing strategy in each phase
4. **Consider Dependencies**: Order phases based on technical dependencies
5. **Allow for Discovery**: Leave room for requirements discovered during implementation

### Status Management

1. **Regular Updates**: Update status at least weekly during active development
2. **Detailed Progress**: Use sub-tasks and checkmarks for granular tracking
3. **Clear Descriptions**: Write status descriptions that non-technical stakeholders can understand
4. **Honest Assessment**: Don't mark items complete until they're truly finished

### Implementation Tracking

1. **Commit References**: Link commits to roadmap phases
2. **Issue Tracking**: Reference roadmap items in issue descriptions
3. **Code Comments**: Reference roadmap sections in complex implementations
4. **Documentation**: Keep implementation docs updated with roadmap

### Quality Assurance

1. **Testing Strategy**: Define testing approach for each phase
2. **Review Process**: Include code review requirements
3. **Performance Metrics**: Set performance goals for each phase
4. **User Acceptance**: Define completion criteria for user-facing features

## Adaptation Guidelines

This template can be adapted for:

- **Different Technologies**: Replace file extensions and patterns as needed
- **Team Sizes**: Adjust phase scope based on team capacity
- **Project Types**: Modify phase structure for different project types
- **Timelines**: Scale phase complexity based on available time
- **Complexity Levels**: Add or remove detail based on project complexity

Use this template as a starting point, then customize based on your specific project needs, team structure, and technical requirements.
