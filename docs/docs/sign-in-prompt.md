- Add a Password table to the database in the "public" schema with "length" (number) and "hash" (string) columns.
- Add a DEV_PASSWORD env var
- Update the seed file to create user data with names, roles, and organization names and avatar images. There should be two organizations, one should be a health care facility and the other a corporation. The quiz content and organizations names should reflect these themes. The seed file should create all the users with the DEV_PASSWORD. The seed script should also delete any existing row in the Password table and add a row with the hashed DEV_PASSWORD in the "hash" columns and the length of the unhashed password in the "length" column.
- Remove the existing UX from @app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx . When the page loads, there should be a single shadcn card component with only a password input. The password input is sleek and modern. On page load, the component should use a query hook to fetch the password length. Once the length of the value in the password input matches the length of the stored password, a useMutation hook should be used to verify the password in the db. While the useMutation hooks is pending it should show a loading spinner on the right hand side of the password input. If the password is invalid then the input should clear and the loading spinner should change to an "X" icon before fading out. If the password is valid then the loading spinner should change to a checkmark icon and the input should become disabled and grayed out. If the passowrd is entered correctly then the card that contains the password input should expand and reveal a set of user cards. Each card is a thin rectangle with an avatar image circle on the left (populated from the user.image column) and a centered horizontal line on the right. Above the line is the user name in large font, below the line is the user email in smaller front. The cards are grouped by organization, with a column for each organization on large screens and the super-admin user card centered above the two organizations. On small screens the cards are stacked vertically with the super-admin user card on top. Each user card is a button that will sign in using the email of the selected user card and the password that was entered into the password input. The sign in is handled in a useMutation hook that implements the signIn method exported from the better-auth client ( @lib/auth-client.ts ). When a user card is clicked, the avatar should be replaced with a loading spinner. On successful sign in, the user should be redirected to the home page. The signIn mutation hook should show a success or error toast on completion as shown in @docs/util.mt
- Add another env var called NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_PASSWORD. If this value is defined then the password input on the sign in page should default to it.
