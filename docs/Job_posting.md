I am looking to develop a web-based Learning Management System. The platform will need to have two sections: one for healthcare patients and the other sections for corporations.

The key functions include:

1. web-based
2. Individual logins
3. Organizations must be able to manage their staff or patients
4. Learning sessions must be AI-informed to prompt questions
5. Bypass to other sections of the presentations
6. Collect data from questions prompts and can be retrieved
7. Connect to a CRM or data visualization tool for reporting
