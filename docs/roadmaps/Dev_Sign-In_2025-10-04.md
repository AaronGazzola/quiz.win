- ✅ Added NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_PASSWORD for client-side password pre-fill (optional)
- ✅ Updated .env.example with placeholder values

### ✅ 1.3 Database Migration

Generated Prisma client with current schema:

- ✅ Ran `npx prisma generate`
- ✅ Password table exists in public schema
- ✅ Schema synchronized with database

## ✅ Phase 2: Seed Script Enhancement
