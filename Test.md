- **Any Operation (Others)**: ❌ **MUST FAIL** - Cannot access other users' profiles
  ✓ Validates profile privacy between users

### Stress Test Execution Pattern

For each combination of **[User Role] × [Table] × [CRUD Operation]**:

1. **Setup User Context**: Authenticate as the specific user role
2. **Attempt Operation**: Execute the CRUD operation with proper test data
3. **Validate Result**:
   - If operation should be **allowed**: Ensure it succeeds and returns expected data
   - If operation should be **prohibited**: Ensure it fails with proper authorization error
4. **Verify Data Integrity**: Confirm no unintended side effects or data leakage
5. **Test Cross-Organization Boundaries**: Validate data isolation between organizations

### Expected Test Metrics

- **Total Test Cases**: ~490 individual permission tests
  - 7 User Roles × 8 Tables × ~9 Operation Scenarios = 504 tests
  - Minus auth schema tests (should all fail) = ~448 meaningful permission tests
- **Auth Schema Protection**: 56 tests (7 roles × 8 auth tables × 1 operation) - All should FAIL
- **Organization Isolation**: 168 cross-org tests - All should FAIL appropriately
- **User Data Privacy**: 84 cross-user tests - All should FAIL appropriately
- **Valid Operations**: 182 authorized operations - All should SUCCEED

### Performance Requirements

- **Execution Time**: < 60 seconds for complete suite
- **Database Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup after each test to prevent pollution
- **Concurrent Safety**: Tests should be isolated and not interfere with each other
- **Error Reporting**: Clear distinction between expected failures (security working) and unexpected failures (bugs)
